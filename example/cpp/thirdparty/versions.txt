# This file is used by `download_dependencies.sh` and cmake to figure out which
# version of a dependency to fetch. In order to add a new dependency, add a
# version variable, e.g. MY_DEP_VERSION and append an entry in the
# `DEPENDENCIES` array (see the comment on top of the declaration for the
# format).
